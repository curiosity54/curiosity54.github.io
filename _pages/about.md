I am a postdoc at MIT, funded by the School of Engineering's [Postdoc Fellowship for Excellence in Engineering](https://engineering.mit.edu/the-mit-postdoctoral-fellowship-program-for-engineering-exce
llence/)! <br>
In August 2024 I finished my PhD at the [Lab of Computational Science and Modeling](https://cosmo.epfl.ch) at EPFL, which I called home since the summer of 2020. <br> Before embarking on this adventur
e, I was working on getting my Masters at the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, where I started given my fascination with the stars and mysteries of the giant worlds beyond our world,
but ended up falling in love with the dynamics of objects on the opposite end of the length scale. My current research interests include machine learning (ML) enabled simulations at the atomic scale,
incorporating symmetries (equivariance) in these frameworks and unifying them with electronic structure.
