Is it me, have I just ‚Äúburnt‚Äù out? Or is the reality undeniably all that ensues</p> <p>My world is burning, fish and turtles choke, due to people‚Äôs actions unplanned Leaves‚Äôve crumpled, bird song‚Äôs muted, air‚Äôs polluted and lake‚Äôs turned to sand, It‚Äôs time to change, eh, mate? Not all our interactions need be a transaction I dream of a world where we change our ways and take some action</p> <p>My world is burning, a mother clenches on for life for her dying son Shackled spirits, prisoners of war, bloodshed, bombs and guns Why can‚Äôt we muster some courage to stop, for peace and quiet? I dream of a world without terrorism, subjugation and race riots</p> <p>My world is burning, abuses hurled, beaten black and blue, I got blamed For provoking an ‚Äòinnocent man‚Äô to be lustful and violent - that‚Äôs how I got raped?! Where my identity, orientation, I decide - where I won‚Äôt be labeled or commodified I dream of a world where I‚Äôd be me, not only someone‚Äôs daughter, wife or merchandise</p> <p>Should I fight for my conviction or lament these fantasies that we would never realize? Oh how I hope the dream of reclaiming my power, strength, and sanity would materialize The raging fire somehow lights an internal candle of hope I dream of rising like a phoenix from the ashes, that‚Äôs the only way I can cope Nightmares will fade, paving the way to a beautiful, imminent transformation Rejoice and cheer as together we behold and enable the dawn of a new creation! ü§©</p> </blockquote>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="posts"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another poem that feels so apt]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Uprooting, challenging, ‚Ä¶</title><link href="https://curiosity54.github.io//blog/2024/uprooting/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Uprooting, challenging, ‚Ä¶"/><published>2024-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://curiosity54.github.io//blog/2024/uprooting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://curiosity54.github.io//blog/2024/uprooting/"><![CDATA[<p>Scrolling through my archives today, found this poem I wrote almost 7 years ago, that still inspires me today!</p> <blockquote> <p>Longing eyes, shackled spirit, bowed head- veiled Subjecting to this oppression- I failed! Standards, restrictions and stereotypes unfurl Pride and ambitions subdued just because I am a girl! Refuse to be subordinated or comply, I rebel In my own quixotic world of justice and equality, I dwell! I am proud of being a woman For I am not prey to such ideologies inhumane It makes me dance with joy..that I am different from the crowd Soaring like a free bird through the stars and the happy clouds I will not be invisible or silent for any long This is my long suppressed voice, my song Education, insight and courage have empowered Certainly, I will not back down and be a coward Will not bow to restrictions and patriarchy Demolish this unjustifiable hierarchy Tired of being subjected to your whims and fancies Why associate femininity with only roses and pansies? You can only lock away books, opportunities and rights But cannot restrict my might or limit the power of my mind Resilient, strong, empowered and tough The journey has been rough, but now it‚Äôs enough. Now, I spread my wings and far I fly Not one of your plotted schemes can stop me, whatever you try. The non-conformist spirit has been ignited Spirit, soul and aspirations united No more domination, blinding or imposing your desire Freedom and happiness bring a world much higher. Break o break all shackles and chains Free myself from all the fears and pains Burn up trepidation, violence and cruelty in flames A world where I will not get the blame For provoking an ‚Äòinnocent man‚Äô to rape As to why domestic violence did take shape A world where I can decide My sexual orientation would not subdue my pride! Where I will not be labelled or commodified Not known only as someone‚Äôs daughter, wife or merchandise. Alas this world is only an illusion Unless we act and shatter the delusion Think, reflect and rewrite our destiny Based on the tenets of equality and harmony Sow the seeds of courage and freedom in our heart Create a world that stands apart!</p> </blockquote>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="posts"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scrolling through my archives today, found this poem I wrote almost 7 years ago, that still inspires me today!]]></summary></entry></feed>
