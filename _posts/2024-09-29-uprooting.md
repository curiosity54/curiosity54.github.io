Scrolling through my archives today, found this poem I wrote almost 7 years ago, that still inspires me today!

> Longing eyes, shackled spirit, bowed head- veiled <br>
> Subjecting to this oppression- I failed!<br>
> Standards, restrictions and stereotypes unfurl<br>
> Pride and ambitions subdued just because I am a girl!<br>
> Refuse to be subordinated or comply, I rebel<br>
> In my own quixotic world of justice and equality, I dwell!<br>
> I am proud of being a woman<br>
> For I am not prey to such ideologies inhumane<br>
> It makes me dance with joy..that I am different from the crowd<br>
> Soaring like a free bird through the stars and the happy clouds<br>
> I will not be invisible or silent for any long<br>
> This is my long suppressed voice, my song<br>
> Education, insight and courage have empowered<br>
> Certainly, I will not back down and be a coward<br>
> Will not bow to restrictions and patriarchy<br>
> Demolish this unjustifiable hierarchy<br>
> Tired of being subjected to your whims and fancies<br>
> Why associate femininity with only roses and pansies?<br>
> You can only lock away books, opportunities and rights<br>
> But cannot restrict my might or limit the power of my mind<br>
> Resilient, strong, empowered and tough<br>
> The journey has been rough, but now it’s enough.<br>
> Now, I spread my wings and far I fly<br>
> Not one of your plotted schemes can stop me, whatever you try.<br>
> The non-conformist spirit has been ignited<br>
> Spirit, soul and aspirations united<br>
> No more domination, blinding or imposing your desire<br>
> Freedom and happiness bring a world much higher.<br>
> Break o break all shackles and chains<br>
> Free myself from all the fears and pains<br>
> Burn up trepidation, violence and cruelty in flames<br>
> A world where I will not get the blame<br>
> For provoking an ‘innocent man’ to rape<br>
> As to why domestic violence did take shape<br>
> A world where I can decide<br>
> My sexual orientation would not subdue my pride!<br>
> Where I will not be labelled or commodified<br>
> Not known only as someone’s daughter, wife or merchandise.<br>
> Alas this world is only an illusion<br>
> Unless we act and shatter the delusion<br>
> Think, reflect and rewrite our destiny<br>
> Based on the tenets of equality and harmony<br>
> Sow the seeds of courage and freedom in our heart<br>
> Create a world that stands apart!<br>
