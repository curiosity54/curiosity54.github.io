Scrolling through my archives today, found this poem I wrote almost 7 years ago, that still inspires me today!

> Longing eyes, shackled spirit, bowed head- veiled
> Subjecting to this oppression- I failed!
> Standards, restrictions and stereotypes unfurl
> Pride and ambitions subdued just because I am a girl!
> Refuse to be subordinated or comply, I rebel
> In my own quixotic world of justice and equality, I dwell!
> I am proud of being a woman
> For I am not prey to such ideologies inhumane
> It makes me dance with joy..that I am different from the crowd
> Soaring like a free bird through the stars and the happy clouds
> I will not be invisible or silent for any long
> This is my long suppressed voice, my song
> Education, insight and courage have empowered
> Certainly, I will not back down and be a coward
> Will not bow to restrictions and patriarchy
> Demolish this unjustifiable hierarchy
> Tired of being subjected to your whims and fancies
> Why associate femininity with only roses and pansies?
> You can only lock away books, opportunities and rights
> But cannot restrict my might or limit the power of my mind
> Resilient, strong, empowered and tough
> The journey has been rough, but now it’s enough.
> Now, I spread my wings and far I fly
> Not one of your plotted schemes can stop me, whatever you try.
> The non-conformist spirit has been ignited
> Spirit, soul and aspirations united
> No more domination, blinding or imposing your desire
> Freedom and happiness bring a world much higher.
> Break o break all shackles and chains
> Free myself from all the fears and pains
> Burn up trepidation, violence and cruelty in flames
> A world where I will not get the blame
> For provoking an ‘innocent man’ to rape
> As to why domestic violence did take shape
> A world where I can decide
> My sexual orientation would not subdue my pride!
> Where I will not be labelled or commodified
> Not known only as someone’s daughter, wife or merchandise.
> Alas this world is only an illusion
> Unless we act and shatter the delusion
> Think, reflect and rewrite our destiny
> Based on the tenets of equality and harmony
> Sow the seeds of courage and freedom in our heart
> Create a world that stands apart!
