Another poem that feels so apt

*My world is burning* 

> Found myself here in the dark, in the midst of ruins, ashes, smoke and flames <br>
> My world is burning in ways more than one, nothing could ever be the same<br>
> Feeling less and less like myself, each passing minute, every other hour<br>
> Don’t know how to tame the fire, to ask for help - I have lost all words, all power<br>
> Bright blue water, cool breeze and the scent of tropical flowers: was it too good to be true?<br>
> Is it me, have I just “burnt” out? Or is the reality undeniably all that ensues<br>
> <br>
> My world is burning, fish and turtles choke, due to people’s actions unplanned<br>
> Leaves’ve crumpled, bird song’s muted, air’s polluted and lake’s turned to sand,<br>
>  It’s time to change, eh, mate? Not all our interactions need be a transaction<br>
> I dream of a world where we change our ways and take some action<br>
> <br>
> My world is burning, a mother clenches on for life for her dying son<br>
> Shackled spirits, prisoners of war, bloodshed, bombs and guns<br>
> Why can’t we muster some courage to stop, for peace and quiet?<br>
> I dream of a world without terrorism, subjugation and race riots<br>
> <br>
> My world is burning, abuses hurled, beaten black and blue, I got blamed<br>
> For provoking an ‘innocent man’ to be lustful and violent - that’s how I got raped?!<br>
> Where my identity, orientation, I decide - where I won’t be labeled or commodified<br>
> I dream of a world where I’d be me, not only someone’s daughter, wife or merchandise<br>
> <br>
> Should I fight for my conviction or lament these fantasies that we would never realize?<br>
> Oh how I hope the dream of reclaiming my power, strength, and sanity would materialize<br>
> The raging fire somehow lights an internal candle of hope<br>
> I dream of rising like a phoenix from the ashes, that’s the only way I can cope<br>
> Nightmares will fade, paving the way to a beautiful, imminent transformation<br>
> Rejoice and cheer as together we behold and enable the dawn of a new creation! 🤩<br>
